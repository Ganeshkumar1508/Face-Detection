# Face Detection using OpenCV
## What is Face Detection?
*Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.* 
## What are Haar Cascades?
- *Haar Cascade classifiers are an effective way for object detection.* 
- *Proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features.
- *It is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier.
  - *Positive images – These images contain the images which we want our classifier to identify.
  - *Negative Images – Images of everything else, which do not contain the object we want to detect.
## Haar-cascade Detection in Python(OpenCV)
- *OpenCV comes as a detector which uses Haar Cascade.
- *In face detection, we use the *Haarcascade Frontal Face* which is in `xml` format.
## Requirements
1. opencv-python - *Wrapper package for OpenCV python bindings.*
```
pip install opencv-python
```
2. haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
